    <h1>Some of my favourite sites</h1>
    <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favourite sites is called
      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia.</a> This terrific site
      allows ordinary users to enter encyclopedia definitions. Over time, the
      entries can be as reliable as a commercial encyclopedia, and a lot more
      complete.
    </p>
    <h2>Dummies</h2>
    <p>
      You can find out a lot about upcoming and current Dummies books at
      <a href="http://www.dummies.com">www.dummies.com</a>. You might even find
      this book mentioned there.
